### Working with Git



### Git Branch Commands:

1. **Create a New Branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch feature-branch
   ```

2. **Switch to a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git switch feature-branch
   ```
   (Note: In Git versions 2.23 and later, you can use `git switch` instead of `git checkout`)

3. **Create and Switch to a New Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-feature-branch
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git switch -c new-feature-branch
   ```

4. **List Branches:**
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

### Git Merge Commands:

1. **Merge a Branch into the Current Branch:**
   ```bash
   # First, switch to the branch where you want to merge changes
   git switch main

   # Then, merge the feature-branch into main
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

### Git Rebase Commands:

1. **Rebase a Branch onto Another Branch:**
   ```bash
   # First, switch to the branch that you want to rebase (e.g., feature-branch)
   git switch feature-branch

   # Then, rebase feature-branch onto main
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Interactive Rebase:**
   ```bash
   # Start an interactive rebase to squash or re-order commits
   git rebase -i HEAD~n
   ```
   - An interactive rebase opens a text editor with a list of commits. You can choose to squash, edit, reword, or delete commits.

3. **Continue After Resolving Conflicts During Rebase:**
   ```bash
   # If conflicts occur during rebase, resolve them manually and then continue
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. **Abort a Rebase:**
   ```bash
   # If something goes wrong during rebase, you can abort it
   git rebase --abort
   ```

### Example Scenario:

Let's walk through an example scenario:

1. **Create a Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

2. **Make Changes, Commit:**
   ```bash
   # Make changes to files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement new feature"
   ```

3. **Switch to Main, Merge Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   git switch main
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

4. **Create and Switch to Another Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b another-feature-branch
   ```

5. **Make Changes, Commit:**
   ```bash
   # Make changes to files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Another feature implementation"
   ```

6. **Rebase Another Feature Branch onto Main:**
   ```bash
   git switch another-feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```




#### Merging in Git
Merging is the process of combining changes from different branches into a single branch. Here's how to perform a merge in Git:

- **Basic Merging:**
  - Switch to the branch where you want to merge changes.
  - Use the `git merge` command followed by the branch name to merge changes.

- **Fast-forward Merging:**
  - When the branch being merged is a direct ancestor, Git performs a fast-forward merge.

#### c. Multiple Commits (Squash Commits) in Git
Squashing commits allows combining multiple commits into a single commit for cleaner version history:

- **Squashing Commits:**
  - Use `git rebase -i HEAD~n`, where n is the number of commits you want to squash.
  - In the interactive rebase, replace "pick" with "squash" or "s" for the commits you want to squash.

#### d. Merge Conflicts in Git
Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches. Common scenarios leading to conflicts include:

- **Simultaneous Edits:**
  - When two branches modify the same line in conflicting ways.

- **Deleted File or Renamed Files:**
  - Conflicts can occur when one branch deletes a file or renames it while the other modifies it.

#### e. Handling Merge Conflicts
To resolve merge conflicts, follow these steps:

- **Locate Conflicts:**
  - Git marks conflicted files. Open these files to locate and resolve conflicts manually.

- **Resolve Conflicts:**
  - Edit the conflicted files, keeping the desired changes.

- **Mark as Resolved:**
  - Use `git add` to mark the files as resolved.

- **Complete Merge:**
  - Continue with `git merge --continue` or `git rebase --continue` to complete the merge.
